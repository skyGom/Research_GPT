The XL backdoor in question refers to a malicious code inserted into XZ Utils, a Linux compression tool used for managing large files. This backdoor, detected by a volunteer named Andres Freund, was present in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the XZ libraries. The backdoor aimed to compromise SSH servers by exploiting encrypted logins undetected, potentially affecting a vast number of Linux systems worldwide. The malicious code was added to the project by JiaT75, a maintainer who had manipulated the development process to introduce the vulnerability. This incident highlights both the strengths and vulnerabilities of relying on unpaid volunteers for maintaining critical open-source infrastructure.
